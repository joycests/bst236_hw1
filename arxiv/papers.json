      "abstract": "Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has enabled agents that can interpret imagery, connect it with language, and perform structured analytical tasks. Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models.",

Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\\bf \\texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $\u03c0_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.",

However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.",

We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.",

Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints. A practical challenge is that relevance is often graded: users accept substitutes or complements beyond exact matches, and production systems benefit from clear separation of similarity scores across these relevance strata for stable hybrid blending and thresholding. To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space. Robustness is additionally improved through additive spelling augmentation and synthetic query generation. Extensive offline evaluations and production A/B tests show that our framework improves retrieval relevance and delivers statistically significant gains in engagement and business impact.",

In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources.",

      "abstract": "Humans can infer the three-dimensional structure of objects from two-dimensional visual inputs. Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page.",

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.",

      "abstract": "Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.",

This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller.

These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers.

Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization.

While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \\textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Phase-only computer-generated holography (CGH) seeks a phase pattern for a spatial light modulator (SLM) whose propagated optical field reproduces a desired intensity distribution. In the far-field (Fraunhofer) regime, optical propagation reduces to a Fourier transform, such that each hologram pixel contributes to the entire reconstructed intensity distribution. When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization. We further observe that patch tokenization strongly shapes the optimization geometry: coarse tokenization acts as an implicit spectral regularizer that stabilizes training and suppresses checkerboard-like attractors, while finer tokenization increases spatial degrees of freedom but benefits from curriculum or hierarchical refinement. Despite training on limited primitives and restricted digit subsets, the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns. These results suggest that transformer architectures, whose self-attention enables global token interactions, are a natural fit for far-field holography and provide a viable foundation for scalable physics-grounded hologram generation.",

Traditional contention-based protocols resolve collisions through control packet exchanges, significantly reducing goodput. DRP mitigates this issue by employing a distributed delay timer mechanism that assigns transmission-start delays based on the average link quality between a sender and its children, prioritizing highly connected nodes for early transmission. However, our in-field experiments reveal that DRP is unable to accommodate real-world link quality fluctuations, leading to overlapping transmissions from multiple senders. This overlap triggers CSMA's random back-off delays, ultimately degrading the goodput performance.\n  To address these shortcomings, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that characterizes the design requirements induced by real-world link quality fluctuations and DRP's passive acknowledgments. Guided by this analysis, we design EDRP, which integrates two novel components: (i) Link-Quality Aware CSMA (LQ-CSMA) and (ii) a Machine Learning-based Block Size Selection (ML-BSS) algorithm for rateless codes. LQ-CSMA dynamically restricts the back-off delay range based on real-time link quality estimates, ensuring that nodes with stronger connectivity experience shorter delays. ML-BSS algorithm predicts future link quality conditions and optimally adjusts the block size for rateless coding, reducing overhead and enhancing goodput.

However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants.

      "abstract": "Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model.

In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods.

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity.

We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.",

We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.",

      "abstract": "As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.\n  Our project page: https://canonical-multimodal.github.io/",

We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance.

Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $\u03be$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $\u03bb> 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(\u03bb)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(\u03bb) \\neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $\u03be^\\star(\u03bb)$ for any value of $\u03bb$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\\operatorname{sign}(\u03be^\\star(\u03bb))=-\\operatorname{sign}(R'(\u03bb))$. In particular, $\u03be^\\star(\u03bb)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $\u03be^\\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method.",

The proposed RMM-C46 input space for ML preserves the physical block structure of the RMM through aggregated invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components, reducing the size of the original RMM by over an order of magnitude while maintaining interpretability. Applied to simulated proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, these representations match or exceed the discriminative performance of the full RMM in both supervised and unsupervised ML tasks.

However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing.",

Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.",

Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.",

It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. We highlight representative workflows for estimation problems such as the average treatment effect (ATE), ATE on treated (ATT), and average marginal effect estimation.

      "abstract": "Fine-grained skill representations, commonly referred to as knowledge components (KCs), are fundamental to many approaches in student modeling and learning analytics. However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.",

The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.",

A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.\n  In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries\n  in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.\n  Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time.

Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces.",

Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.",

Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains.",

Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix.

In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.",

Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints.\n  Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\\pm 1$ weights.

To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-\u0398(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\\exp(-\u0398(t/(m^{2}\\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems.

In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

However, their embedded sensing relies on capacitive sensors with limited precision, which hinders accurate control. We introduce OS-ERA, an optically sensorized ERA that yields reliable proprioceptive information, and we focus on the design and integration of a sensing solution without affecting actuation. To analyse the complex curvature of an ERA in motion, we design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors. A classifier is trained to map the sensing signals in order to distinguish eight bending states. We validate our model on six held-out trials and compare it against signals' trajectories learned from training runs. Across all tests, the sensing output signals follow the training manifold, and the predicted sequence mirrors real performance and confirms repeatability. Despite deliberate train-test mismatches in actuation speed, the signal trajectories preserve their shape, and classification remains consistently accurate, demonstrating practical voltage- and speed-invariance. As a result, OS-ERA classifies bending states with high fidelity; it is fast and repeatable, solving a longstanding bottleneck of the ERA, enabling steps toward closed-loop control.",

By enabling compatibility with existing camera-based sensing platforms, the system extends the operational reliability of automated vehicles without requiring additional high-cost sensors or hardware replacements. This approach reduces resource consumption, supports modular upgrades, and promotes more cost-efficient deployment of automated vehicle technologies, particularly in challenging weather conditions where system failures would otherwise lead to inefficiencies and increased emissions.

Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.\n  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \\textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.\n  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \\textit{AI memory}).",

Recent designs incorporating optical circuit switches (OCSes) are promising, offering improved cost, power efficiency, and long-term bandwidth scaling than packet switches. However, most existing approaches rely on costly high-radix OCSes and/or combine them with packet switches to achieve competitive performance at scale. Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance.\n  We propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future.",

We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.",

To address these challenges, we propose ILRec, a novel preference fine-tuning framework for LLM-based recommendation, leveraging self-hard negative signals extracted from intermediate layers to improve preference learning. Specifically, we identify self-hard negative tokens from intermediate layers as fine-grained negative supervision that dynamically reflects the model's preference learning process. To effectively integrate these signals into training, we design a two-stage framework comprising cross-layer preference optimization and cross-layer preference distillation, enabling the model to jointly discriminate informative negatives and enhance the quality of negative signals from intermediate layers. In addition, we introduce a lightweight collaborative filtering model to assign token-level rewards for negative signals, mitigating the risk of over-penalizing false negatives.

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models.

We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned.

This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.",

A policy is treated as the latent variable and is assigned an unnormalized probability of optimality that is monotone in its expected return, yielding a posterior distribution whose modes coincide with return-maximizing solutions while posterior dispersion represents uncertainty over optimal behavior. To approximate this posterior in discrete domains, we adapt variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) to inference over deterministic policies under stochastic dynamics, introducing a sweep that enforces policy consistency across revisited states and couples transition randomness across particles to avoid confounding from simulator noise. Acting is performed by posterior predictive sampling, which induces a stochastic control policy through a Thompson-sampling interpretation rather than entropy regularization. Across grid worlds, Blackjack, Triangle Tireworld, and Academic Advising, we analyze the structure of inferred policy distributions and compare the resulting behavior to discrete Soft Actor-Critic, highlighting qualitative and statistical differences that arise from policy-level uncertainty.",

These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling.",

In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance.",

We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution.

Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data.

In those scenarios, the common practice is to drop items with missing modalities and train the multimodal RSs on a subsample of the original dataset. To date, the problem of missing modalities in multimodal recommendation has still received limited attention in the literature, lacking a precise formalisation as done with missing information in traditional machine learning. In this work, we first provide a problem formalisation for missing modalities in multimodal recommendation. Second, by leveraging the user-item graph structure, we re-cast the problem of missing multimodal information as a problem of graph features interpolation on the item-item co-purchase graph. On this basis, we propose four training-free approaches that propagate the available multimodal features throughout the item-item graph to impute the missing features. Extensive experiments on popular multimodal recommendation datasets demonstrate that our solutions can be seamlessly plugged into any existing multimodal RS and benchmarking framework while still preserving (or even widen) the performance gap between multimodal and traditional RSs. Moreover, we show that our graph-based techniques can perform better than traditional imputations in machine learning under different missing modalities settings. Finally, we analyse (for the first time in multimodal RSs) how feature homophily calculated on the item-item graph can influence our graph-based imputations.",

In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology.

Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines.",

Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.\n  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics.",

We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. The system employs compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels on a per-pair basis, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups. On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity. By co-designing indexing, similarity fusion, and equity-aware objectives, SubQuad offers a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational tasks such as vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.",

      "abstract": "We introduce WebFAQ 2.0, a new version of the WebFAQ dataset, containing 198 million FAQ-based natural question-answer pairs across 108 languages. Compared to the previous version, it significantly expands multilingual coverage and the number of bilingual aligned QA pairs to over 14.3M, making it the largest FAQ-based resource. Unlike the original release, WebFAQ 2.0 uses a novel data collection strategy that directly crawls and extracts relevant web content, resulting in a substantially more diverse and multilingual dataset with richer context through page titles and descriptions. In response to community feedback, we also release a hard negatives dataset for training dense retrievers, with 1.25M queries across 20 languages. These hard negatives were mined using a two-stage retrieval pipeline and include cross-encoder scores for 200 negatives per query. We further show how this resource enables two primary fine-tuning strategies for dense retrievers: Contrastive Learning with MultipleNegativesRanking loss, and Knowledge Distillation with MarginMSE loss. WebFAQ 2.0 is not a static resource but part of a long-term effort. Since late 2025, structured FAQs are being regularly released through the Open Web Index, enabling continuous expansion and refinement. We publish the datasets and training scripts to facilitate further research in multilingual and cross-lingual IR. The dataset itself and all related resources are publicly available on GitHub and HuggingFace.",

      "abstract": "Detecting tampered text in document images is a challenging task due to data scarcity. To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods. However, the resulting documents often suffer from limited variety and poor visual quality, typically leaving highly visible artifacts that are rarely observed in real-world manipulations. This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols. Evaluating these models on various open-source datasets shows that our pipeline yields consistent performance improvements across architectures and datasets.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet early risk detection is often limited by available diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits (FMAB), a new MAB framework where the set of available arms (or actions) can change at each round, and the available set at any time may depend on the agent's previously selected arm. We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation. We establish high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. We show that the exploration cost of our algorithm is near-optimal by establishing a matching information-theoretic lower bound for this problem class, highlighting the fundamental cost of exploration under local-move constraints. We complement our theoretical guarantees with numerical simulations, including a scenario of a robotic ground vehicle scouting a disaster-affected region.",

      "abstract": "Open datasets play a crucial role in three research domains that intersect data science and education: learning analytics, educational data mining, and artificial intelligence in education. Researchers in these domains apply computational methods to analyze data from educational contexts, aiming to better understand and improve teaching and learning. Providing open datasets alongside research papers supports reproducibility, collaboration, and trust in research findings. It also provides individual benefits for authors, such as greater visibility, credibility, and citation potential. Despite these advantages, the availability of open datasets and the associated practices within the learning analytics research communities, especially at their flagship conference venues, remain unclear. We surveyed available datasets published alongside research papers in learning analytics. We manually examined 1,125 papers from three flagship conferences (LAK, EDM, and AIED) over the past five years. We discovered, categorized, and analyzed 172 datasets used in 204 publications. Our study presents the most comprehensive collection and analysis of open educational datasets to date, along with the most detailed categorization. Of the 172 datasets identified, 143 were not captured in any prior survey of open data in learning analytics. We provide insights into the datasets' context, analytical methods, use, and other properties. Based on this survey, we summarize the current gaps in the field. Furthermore, we list practical recommendations, advice, and 8-item guidelines under the acronym PRACTICE with a checklist to help researchers publish their data. Lastly, we share our original dataset: an annotated inventory detailing the discovered datasets and the corresponding publications. We hope these findings will support further adoption of open data practices in learning analytics communities and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly important for cyber-physical systems (CPS), where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data are available. Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making.",
